# Pepper-Project
Using a Raspberry Pi 3 to control a makeshift greenhouse built into my desk. This repo hosts the source code for monitoring and controlling it. This includes:

 - Python function to read Si7021 breakout from Adafruit
 - Function to control a small brushless 5V fan ran from RPi3 output
 - Function to control LED grow lights to simulate night and day
 - Function to control heating element to keep ¨greenhouse¨ warm
 - Wrapper function to make it all go
